# Module 01: Advanced Data Structures

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, you will:
- Master the collections module (Counter, defaultdict, deque, namedtuple)
- Write efficient comprehensions with complex conditions
- Understand when to use each data structure
- Use unpacking and destructuring effectively

## 📖 Topics Covered

### 1. Collections Module
- **Counter**: Count hashable objects efficiently
- **defaultdict**: Dictionaries with default values
- **deque**: Double-ended queue for efficient append/pop
- **namedtuple**: Lightweight object types
- **OrderedDict**: Remember insertion order (less needed in Python 3.7+)
- **ChainMap**: Combine multiple dictionaries

### 2. Comprehensions
- List comprehensions with conditions
- Dictionary comprehensions
- Set comprehensions
- Nested comprehensions
- When to use vs when to avoid

### 3. Unpacking & Destructuring
- Extended unpacking with *
- Dictionary unpacking with **
- Swapping variables
- Ignoring values with _

## 🏃 Getting Started

1. Open `examples.py` and type each example
2. Run the file: `python examples.py`
3. Experiment by modifying the code
4. Complete the exercises in `exercises.py`
5. Compare with `solutions.py`

## 💡 Key Takeaways

- **Counter** is perfect for counting occurrences
- **defaultdict** eliminates key checking
- **deque** is faster than list for queue operations
- Comprehensions are more Pythonic than loops
- Use unpacking to make code cleaner
