   - Properties and class methods
   - Abstract base classes

4. **File I/O & Context Managers** ✓
   - File handling best practices
   - Context managers (with statement)
   - Custom context managers
   - Working with different file formats (CSV, JSON)

5. **Error Handling & Exceptions** ✓
   - Exception hierarchy
   - Custom exceptions
   - Error handling patterns
   - Using assertions effectively

### Phase 2: Advanced Python (Weeks 5-8)
6. **Iterators & Generators** ✓
   - Iterator protocol
   - Generator functions and expressions
   - yield, yield from
   - Infinite sequences

7. **Decorators Mastery** ✓
   - Function decorators
   - Class decorators
   - Decorator patterns (memoization, timing, retry)
   - functools module

8. **Advanced OOP Concepts** ✓
   - Metaclasses
   - Descriptors
   - Abstract base classes
   - Multiple inheritance and MRO

9. **Async Programming** ✓

   - Concurrent vs parallel execution
   - Async context managers and iterators

10. **Concurrency & Parallelism** ✓
    - Threading
    - Multiprocessing
    - Concurrent.futures
    - GIL understanding

### Phase 3: Expert Level (Weeks 9-12)
11. **Type Hints & Static Typing** ✓
    - Type annotations
    - Generics
    - Protocols
    - Type checking with mypy

12. **Design Patterns** ✓
    - Creational patterns (Singleton, Factory, Builder)
    - Structural patterns (Adapter, Decorator, Facade)
    - Behavioral patterns (Observer, Strategy, Command)

13. **Performance Optimization** ✓
    - Profiling code
    - Memory optimization
    - Cython basics
    - Using appropriate data structures

14. **Testing & Best Practices** ✓
    - Unit testing with pytest

    - Code quality tools

## 🚀 How to Use This Program

### For Each Module:
1. **Read** the `README.md` in each folder
2. **Type** the examples from `examples.py` (don't copy-paste!)
3. **Run** the code and observe the output
4. **Modify** the code to experiment
5. **Complete** the exercises in `exercises.py`
6. **Check** your solutions against `solutions.py`

### Tips for Success:
- ✍️ **Type everything yourself** - muscle memory is important
- 🧪 **Experiment** - break things, see what happens
- 🐛 **Debug** - use print statements and debugger
- 💡 **Ask "why?"** - understand the reasoning behind each concept
- 🔄 **Practice daily** - consistency beats intensity
- 📝 **Take notes** - document your learnings
