# Module 02: Functions Deep Dive

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, you will:
- Understand functions as first-class objects
- Master closures and variable scoping
- Create and use decorators effectively
- Write clean functional-style code
- Use lambda functions appropriately

## 📖 Topics Covered

### 1. First-Class Functions
- Functions as objects
- Passing functions as arguments
- Returning functions from functions
- Storing functions in data structures

### 2. Closures
- Understanding scope (LEGB rule)
- Creating closures
- Practical use cases
- The `nonlocal` keyword

### 3. Decorators
- Function decorators basics
- Decorators with arguments
- Multiple decorators
- Preserving metadata with `functools.wraps`
- Common decorator patterns

### 4. Lambda Functions
- Lambda syntax
- When to use (and when not to)
- Lambda with map, filter, reduce
- Lambda in sorting

### 5. Advanced Function Features
- *args and **kwargs
- Partial functions
- Function annotations
- Recursion

## 💡 Key Takeaways

- Functions are first-class objects in Python
- Closures capture the enclosing scope
- Decorators add functionality without modifying code
- Use lambdas for simple, one-line functions
- Understanding scope is crucial for advanced Python
