### Phase 2: Core Algorithms (Week 3-4)
4. **Two Pointers** - Array/string problems
5. **Sliding Window** - Time series, subarray problems
6. **Binary Search** - Optimization problems

### Phase 3: Advanced Structures (Week 5-6)
7. **Stacks & Queues** - Parsing, BFS/DFS
8. **Trees & Binary Trees** - Hierarchical data
9. **Graphs** - Network analysis, relationships

### Phase 4: Advanced Patterns (Week 7-8)
10. **Dynamic Programming** - Optimization problems
11. **Backtracking** - Search problems
12. **Greedy Algorithms** - Optimization

## 📁 Structure

Each topic folder contains:
- `README.md` - Concepts, patterns, examples
- `exercises.py` - Hands-on practice problems
- `solutions.py` - Complete solutions with explanations
- `common_patterns.md` - Reusable patterns and templates

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. Start with **Phase 1** topics
2. Complete exercises **without** looking at solutions
3. Review solutions and understand patterns
4. Practice similar problems on LeetCode/HackerRank
5. Move to next phase only after 80% mastery

## 📊 Success Metrics

- ✅ Can solve 5 problems from each topic independently
- ✅ Recognize patterns within 30 seconds of reading problem
- ✅ Implement solutions in < 30 minutes
- ✅ Explain time/space complexity correctly

---

**Remember**: Focus on understanding patterns, not memorizing solutions!
