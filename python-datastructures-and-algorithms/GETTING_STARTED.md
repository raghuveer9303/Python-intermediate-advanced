# 🚀 Getting Started with Python DSA

## Quick Start Guide

### 1. Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+
- Basic Python knowledge
- Text editor or IDE (VS Code, PyCharm, etc.)

### 2. Learning Order

**Week 1-2: Foundation**
1. Start with `01-arrays-lists/`
2. Complete exercises without solutions
3. Review solutions and understand patterns
4. Practice on LeetCode Easy problems

**Week 3-4: Core Algorithms**
1. Move to `02-dictionaries-hashmaps/`
2. Practice frequency counting problems
3. Master `03-string-manipulation/`
4. Learn `04-binary-search/`

**Week 5-6: Advanced**
1. Continue with remaining topics
2. Focus on patterns, not memorization
3. Practice Medium LeetCode problems

### 3. How to Use This Guide

1. **Read the README** - Understand concepts
2. **Attempt exercises** - Don't look at solutions first!
3. **Review solutions** - Understand the approach
4. **Practice similar problems** - LeetCode, HackerRank
5. **Review common patterns** - Study `common_patterns.md`

### 4. Practice Platforms

- **LeetCode** - Best for interview prep
- **HackerRank** - Good for fundamentals
- **CodeSignal** - Interview practice
- **NeetCode** - Curated problem lists

### 5. Success Tips

- ✅ Solve 20-30 problems per topic
- ✅ Focus on patterns, not solutions
- ✅ Explain your approach out loud
- ✅ Practice time complexity analysis
- ✅ Review mistakes regularly

### 6. Common Mistakes to Avoid

- ❌ Looking at solutions too early
- ❌ Memorizing solutions
- ❌ Skipping easy problems
- ❌ Not practicing regularly
- ❌ Ignoring time/space complexity
